# tip-calculator
Description:
The Tip Calculator App is a mobile application designed to help users calculate tips and split bills among friends with ease. The project follows a modern software architecture, combining elements of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), Protocol-Oriented Programming, and Reactive Programming to create a robust and maintainable application.

Key Features:

MVVM Architecture: The project adheres to the MVVM architecture, which separates the user interface (View) from the data and logic (ViewModel). This separation enhances code organization, testability, and maintainability.

Protocol-Oriented Programming: Protocol-oriented programming is used to define clear and reusable interfaces and protocols, promoting code modularity and protocol conformance.

Reactive Programming: Reactive programming with Combine is employed to handle asynchronous and event-driven operations efficiently. It allows for elegant handling of user interactions and data updates.

Dynamic UI with SnapKit: The user interface is created programmatically using SnapKit, a Swift DSL for Auto Layout. This approach provides flexibility in designing responsive layouts and ensures a consistent user experience.

Unit Tests: The project includes a suite of unit tests to validate the correctness of individual components and functions. These tests help catch and prevent bugs during development.

Snapshot Tests: Snapshot tests are utilized to verify that UI components render correctly and consistently across different devices and screen sizes.

UI Tests: Automated UI tests are implemented to simulate user interactions and ensure the application's functionality behaves as expected during integration testing.

Development Tools:

Swift programming language
Xcode IDE
Combine framework for reactive programming
SnapKit for programmatic UI layout
XCTest framework for unit, snapshot, and UI testing
Project Goals:
The primary goals of this project are to create a user-friendly and reliable tip calculator app that follows best practices in software development. By implementing the MVVM architecture, Protocol-Oriented Programming, and Reactive Programming, the app aims to achieve high maintainability, testability, and scalability.

Outcome:
The Tip Calculator App will provide users with a seamless and efficient way to calculate tips and split bills, ensuring accurate results and a satisfying user experience. The adherence to modern software development principles and comprehensive testing will contribute to the app's stability and longevity in the ever-evolving mobile application landscape.
